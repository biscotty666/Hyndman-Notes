# Scatterplots

Exploring relationships between time series

Figures [2.12](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:edemand) and [2.13](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:victemp) show two time series: half-hourly electricity demand (in Gigawatts) and temperature (in degrees Celsius), for 2014 in Victoria, Australia. The temperatures are for Melbourne, the largest city in Victoria, while the demand values are for the entire state.

```{r}
vic_elec |>
  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>
  autoplot(Demand) +
  labs(y = "GW",
       title = "Half-hourly electricity demand: Victoria")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |>
  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>
  autoplot(Temperature) +
  labs(y = "Degrees Celsius",
       title = "Half-hourly temperatures: Melbourne")
```

```{r}
vic_elec |>
  filter(year(Time) == 2014) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Temperature, y = Demand)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'Temperature (degrees Celsius)',
       y = "Electricity demand (GW)")
```

The plot shows a clear relationship when temperatures move above 25deg. Another, smaller effect, at colder temps.

## Correlation

The correlation coefficient only measures the strength of the *linear* relationship between two variables, and can sometimes be misleading. For example, the correlation for the electricity demand and temperature data shown in Figure [2.14](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:edemand2) is 0.28, but the *non-linear* relationship is stronger than that.

Figure 2.16: Each of these plots has a correlation coefficient of 0.82. Data from Anscombe ([1973](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#ref-Anscombe1973graphs)).

## Scatterplot matrices

When there are several potential predictor variables, it is useful to plot each variable against each other variable. Consider the eight time series shown in Figure [2.17](https://otexts.com/fpp3/scatterplots.html#fig:vntimeplots), showing quarterly visitor numbers across states and territories of Australia

```{r fig.height=9, fig.width=6}
visitors <- tourism |>
  group_by(State) |>
  summarise(Trips = sum(Trips))
visitors |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(vars(State), scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Australian domestic tourism",
       y = "Overnight trips ('000")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=10}
visitors |>
  pivot_wider(values_from=Trips, names_from = State) |>
  GGally::ggpairs(columns = 2:9)
```
