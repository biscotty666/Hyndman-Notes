## Moving averages of moving averages

For even-order moving averages, eg. periods of 12 or 4. Apply an M2
period after the even selection.

``` r
beer <- aus_production |>
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992) |>
  select(Quarter, Beer)
beer_ma <- beer |>
  mutate(
    `4-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(Beer, mean,
                               .before = 1, .after = 2,
                               .complete = TRUE),
    `2x4-MA` = slider::slide_dbl(`4-MA`, mean,
                                 .before = 1, .after = 0,
                                 .complete = TRUE)
  )
```

### Weighted moving averages

Combinations of moving averages result in weighted moving averages. For
example, the $2×4$-MA discussed above is equivalent to a weighted 5-MA
with weights given by
$\left[\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8}\right]$.
In general, a weighted m-MA can be written as
$$\hat{T}_t = \sum_{j=-k}^k a_j y_{t+j}$$, where k=(m−1)/2, and the
weights are given by $[a_{-k}, \dots, a_k$. It is important that the
weights all sum to one and that they are symmetric so that
$a_j = a_{-j}$. The simple m-MA is a special case where all of the
weights are equal to 1/m.

A major advantage of weighted moving averages is that they yield a
smoother estimate of the trend-cycle. Instead of observations entering
and leaving the calculation at full weight, their weights slowly
increase and then slowly decrease, resulting in a smoother curve.
