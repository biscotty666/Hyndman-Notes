``` r
us_retail_employment <- us_employment |>
  filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == "Retail Trade") |>
  select(-Series_ID)
```

## X-11

Classical but includes additional steps. Allows for holidays, known
predictors, seasonal component can vary over time.

``` r
x11_dcmp <- us_retail_employment |>
  model(x11 = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Employed ~ x11())) |>
  components()
autoplot(x11_dcmp) +
  labs(title =
    "Decomposition of total US retail employment using X-11.")
```

  geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust,
                colour = "Seasonally Adjusted")) +

## SEATS

``` r

  model(seats = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Employed ~ seats())) |>
  components()
