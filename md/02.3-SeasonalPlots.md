A seasonal plot allows the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen more
clearly, and is especially useful in identifying years in which the
pattern changes.

## Multiple seasonal periods

Where the data has more than one seasonal pattern, the period argument
can be used to select which seasonal plot is required. The vic_elec data
contains half-hourly electricity demand for the state of Victoria,
Australia. We can plot the daily pattern, weekly pattern or yearly
pattern by specifying the period argument as shown in Figures 2.5–2.7.

In the first plot, the three days with 25 hours are when daylight saving
ended in each year and so these days contained an extra hour. There were
also three days with only 23 hours each (when daylight saving started)
but these are hidden beneath all the other lines on the plot.

``` r
vic_elec |> gg_season(Demand, period = "day") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="MWh", title = "Elecricity demand: Victoria")
```
